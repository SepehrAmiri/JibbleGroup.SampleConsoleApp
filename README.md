# JibbleGroup Sample Console Application

## Overview
This console application is designed as a coding exercise for the Jibble Group interview process. It utilizes the public OData API v4 to demonstrate various operations on a dataset of people.

## Features
•  [**List People**](https://www.bing.com/search?form=SKPBOT&q=List%20People): Fetch and display a list of people from the OData service.

•  [**Search/Filter People**](https://www.bing.com/search?form=SKPBOT&q=Search%2FFilter%20People): Provide functionality to search and filter people based on specific criteria.

•  [**View Person Details**](https://www.bing.com/search?form=SKPBOT&q=View%20Person%20Details): Display detailed information about a selected individual.

•  [**Modify Data**](https://www.bing.com/search?form=SKPBOT&q=Modify%20Data): Allow modifications to the data of a person (subject to API permissions).

•  [**Clean Architecture**](https://www.bing.com/search?form=SKPBOT&q=Clean%20Architecture): Adheres to Clean Architecture principles for a maintainable and scalable codebase.

•  [**Domain-Driven Design**](https://www.bing.com/search?form=SKPBOT&q=Domain-Driven%20Design): Incorporates DDD methodologies for a robust business logic layer.

•  [**Repository Pattern**](https://www.bing.com/search?form=SKPBOT&q=Repository%20Pattern): Utilizes the Repository pattern for data access abstraction.

•  [**CQRS with MediatR**](https://www.bing.com/search?form=SKPBOT&q=CQRS%20with%20MediatR): Implements Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS) using the MediatR library.

•  [**Dependency Injection**](https://www.bing.com/search?form=SKPBOT&q=Dependency%20Injection): Leverages .NET's built-in dependency injection features for better testing and decoupling.
